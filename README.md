## Installation

You can download the latest binary from
[here](https://github.com/arsham/figurine/releases), or you can compile from
source:

```bash
go install github.com/arsham/figurine@latest
```

## Usage

Every time the application is called, it chooses a random font for rendering the
message. Pass the message you want to decorate as arguments.

```bash
figurine Some Text
```

You can print available fonts:

```bash
figurine -l
figurine -l -s
```

To set a font:

```bash
figurine -f "Poison.flf" Some Text
```

To get a list of available arguments:

```bash
figurine -h
```

This application is very light weight, so feel free to add it to your
.zshrc/.bashrc file, so each time you open a new shell it shows you a nice
message.
